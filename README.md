# React Contact List

A simple contact list app built with React that allows you to fetch and display contacts from an API, add new contacts, update existing contacts, and delete contacts. Please note that the API calls for adding, updating, and deleting contacts are dummy calls and won't affect the actual server data.

## Features

Fetch and display users from the API: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
Add a contact: Makes a POST call to the API to add a new contact (dummy call)
Update a contact: Makes a PUT call to the API to update an existing contact (dummy call)
Delete a contact: Makes a DELETE call to the API to delete a contact (dummy call)

## Demo

A live demo of the app is deployed on GitHub Pages. You can access it [here](https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>).
